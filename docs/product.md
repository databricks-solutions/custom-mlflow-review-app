# Product Requirements Document
## Custom MLflow Review App Template

### Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:**
Organizations need custom AI/ML model evaluation workflows but face significant technical barriers when building review applications that integrate with MLflow and Databricks. Current solutions either lack customization flexibility or require extensive engineering effort to implement proper data integration.

**Solution:**
A low-code Databricks App Template that provides pre-built MLflow/Databricks API integration ("the plumbing") while enabling full UI/UX customization ("the fixtures") through Claude-assisted development. Users can create custom review applications without building backend infrastructure from scratch.

**Core Value Proposition:**
Democratize AI evaluation by eliminating technical integration complexity while preserving unlimited customization capability.

### Target Users

**Primary Users:**

1. **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)**
   - Role: Complete labeling and review tasks for AI model evaluation
   - Pain Points: Need intuitive interfaces for complex evaluation workflows
   - Goals: Efficiently review conversation data and provide quality feedback
   - Technical Level: Non-technical users

2. **Developers/ML Engineers**
   - Role: Set up review sessions, import traces, monitor progress
   - Pain Points: Building custom evaluation workflows takes too long
   - Goals: Quickly deploy custom review applications with minimal coding
   - Technical Level: Moderate to high technical expertise

**Secondary Users:**

3. **Data Scientists/ML Teams**
   - Role: Configure evaluation schemas and analyze review results
   - Goals: Implement consistent evaluation processes across projects
   - Technical Level: High technical expertise

### Core Features

**For Subject Matter Experts (/)**

1. **Labeling Session Selection**
   - Display list of available labeling sessions
   - Show completion status and progress indicators
   - "Start" button to jump to first unlabeled item

2. **Review Interface**
   - Left side: Conversation display (chat format in base template)
   - Right side: Configurable review questions based on labeling schemas
   - Support for MLflow label schemas: binary classification, rating scales, text feedback
   - Auto-advance to next item after submission
   - Ability to navigate back and modify previous reviews

3. **Session Completion**
   - Completion message when session finished
   - Display other available sessions for continued labeling

**For Developers (/dev)**

4. **Trace Management**
   - Import traces from MLflow experiments via UI
   - Select specific traces to include in labeling sessions
   - Integration with search_traces Python SDK through web interface

5. **Session Creation & Management**
   - Create new labeling sessions
   - Assign traces to sessions
   - Configure labeling schemas (use existing or custom)
   - Monitor completion status and progress analytics

**Template Customization System**

6. **`/custom-review-app` Slash Command**
   - Claude-assisted customization workflow
   - Guide users through conversation format selection
   - Help configure review questions and schemas
   - Enable UI/branding customization
   - Generate customized components automatically
   - Require minimal technical expertise

### User Stories

**SME Workflow:**
1. SME visits app root URL and sees list of available labeling sessions
2. Clicks on session and sees first unlabeled conversation
3. Reviews conversation on left, completes questions on right
4. Submits feedback and auto-advances to next item
5. Completes session and receives completion confirmation

**Developer Workflow:**
1. Developer visits /dev dashboard and sees session overview
2. Creates new labeling session by importing traces from MLflow experiment
3. Configures review schema using standard templates or custom questions
4. Monitors completion progress and exports results when ready

**Customization Workflow:**
1. User runs `/custom-review-app` command in Claude
2. Claude guides through conversation format choices (chat, Q&A, documents)
3. User selects review question types and validation rules
4. Claude generates customized React components and API integrations
5. User deploys customized review app with full Databricks integration intact

### Success Metrics

**Adoption Metrics:**
- Number of custom review apps deployed using template
- Time-to-deployment for new review applications (target: <1 hour)
- User retention rate for SMEs using review interfaces

**Usage Metrics:**
- Number of labeling sessions completed per app
- Average review completion time per conversation
- Developer satisfaction with customization process

**Technical Metrics:**
- API integration reliability (>99% uptime)
- Data synchronization accuracy with MLflow experiments
- Template deployment success rate

### Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Core Template (MVP)**
- Basic SME review interface with chat conversations
