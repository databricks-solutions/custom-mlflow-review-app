   - Generates structured responses with actionable insights

4. **Tool Selection**: Context-aware orchestration
   - Intelligent selection from 49+ specialized tools
   - Sequential execution with workflow dependency management

### Tool Usage Patterns

**49 Different Tools Detected:**

**Infrastructure Tools:**
- `list_warehouses`, `get_warehouse_info`, `check_warehouse_status`
- `get_query_history`, `explain_query`

**Data Exploration Tools:**
- `list_catalogs`, `list_schemas`, `list_tables`, `list_volumes`
- `execute_sql_query` (read-only operations)

**MLflow Tools:**

- Comprehensive troubleshooting guidance

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful failure recovery mechanisms
- Alternative investigation paths when tools fail

## Specific Use Cases (Actual Trace Analysis)

### Primary Use Case: Job Failure Diagnostics
**User Query**: "Our jobs have been failing and I need to check if it's a warehouse issue"

**Agent Investigation Process:**
1. **Warehouse Status Check**: Listed all available SQL warehouses
2. **Status Analysis**: Identified most warehouses were stopped
3. **Active Warehouse Investigation**: Found 2 running warehouses
4. **Query History Analysis**: Examined recent query patterns and failures
5. **Root Cause Identification**: Detected failed queries accessing non-existent tables
6. **Comprehensive Diagnosis**: Generated structured analysis with multiple failure scenarios

**Agent Response Quality:**
- **Structured findings** with clear categorization
- **Specific recommendations** for each identified issue
- **Actionable next steps** with implementation guidance
- **Resource optimization suggestions** for warehouse sizing
